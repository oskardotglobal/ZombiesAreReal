# Zombies Are Real 🧟‍♂️🌌
Dive into a Minecraft world 🌍 where zombies have evolved! Our mod revitalizes their spawning and behavior, making every encounter truly heart-pounding 💓.

## Main Features 🎮
- Freshly Risen Zombies 🧟‍♀️: We've retired the vanilla zombies. In their place, encounter our custom undead. (Note: Mods requiring vanilla zombies may face compatibility issues ❌.)
- Sun-Resistant Walkers ☀️: Gone are the days zombies burned in sunlight. They're now daytime roamers 🌞.
- The Eastern March 🧭: Zombies mysteriously wander towards the east, forming an eerie, coordinated horde.
- Twilight Terrors 🌆: As dusk falls and dawn breaks, prepare for intense zombie horde invasions 🌇.
- Stealthy Spawns 🌲: Zombies won't just pop up in front of you. Instead, they spawn with the terrain, emerging as coherent hordes from the landscape.
